Tupled Out is a game where you roll die three times to get points and add them together. If you roll three of the same numbers, you are Tupled Out and lose all points for the turn. If you roll two of the same numbers you are instead fixed and can't roll them again but you can roll the other roll that is not the same. Besides that you can roll anything you want. Keep playing until you reach five turns or someone reaches 50 points. Good luck.
